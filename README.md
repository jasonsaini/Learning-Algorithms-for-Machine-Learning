Practice with Machine Learning Algorithms!

This repo tracks all my practice projects as I learn different machine learning algorithms

So far I have covered these concepts:
- [x] Exploratory Data Analysis
- [x] Linear Regression
- [ ] Classification
Here are the problem statements for each project:

1) Exploratory Data Analysis:
  This dataset designed to understand the factors that lead a person to leave current job for HR research. By model(s) that uses the current credentials, demographics, experience data you will predict the probability of a candidate to look for a new job or will work for the company, as well as interpreting affected factors on employee decision. This data will be used to create a predictive model related to the context. Perform exploratory data analysis to prepare the data for that model.
  
2) Linear Regression:
An e-commerce company based in Florida sells clothing Online. However, they also have style sessions and clothing advice sessions at their on-site locations. In an in-store session, customers come into the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want. The company is trying to decide whether to focus its efforts on its mobile app experience or its website. Build a predictive model to get an idea of the yearly amount spent by a customer based on their data.
