Practice with Machine Learning Algorithms!

This repo tracks all my practice projects as I learn different machine learning algorithms

So far I have covered these concepts:
- [x] Exploratory Data Analysis
- [x] Linear Regression
- [x] Classification
- [x] K-Means Clustering
- [x] NLP, Deep Learning, Neural Networks  

Here are the problem statements for each project (my favorite was #5) :

1) Exploratory Data Analysis:
  This dataset designed to understand the factors that lead a person to leave current job for HR research. By model(s) that uses the current credentials, demographics, experience data you will predict the probability of a candidate to look for a new job or will work for the company, as well as interpreting affected factors on employee decision. This data will be used to create a predictive model related to the context. Perform exploratory data analysis to prepare the data for that model.
  
2) Linear Regression:
An e-commerce company based in Florida sells clothing Online. However, they also have style sessions and clothing advice sessions at their on-site locations. In an in-store session, customers come into the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want. The company is trying to decide whether to focus its efforts on its mobile app experience or its website. Build a predictive model to get an idea of the yearly amount spent by a customer based on their data. 

3) Classification:
A company which is active in Big Data and Data Science wants to hire data scientists among people who successfully passed related certification courses. They want to know which of these candidates are really wants to work for the company after training or looking for a new employment because it helps to reduce the cost and time as well as the quality of training or planning the courses and categorization of candidates. Information related to demographics, education, experience are in hands from candidates signup and enrollment. This dataset designed to understand the factors that lead a person to leave current job for HR research too. By model(s) that uses the current credentials, demographics, experience data you will predict the probability of a candidate to look for a new job or will work for the company, as well as interpreting affected factors on employee decision. Build a predictive model to classify a candidate to find the probability whether the candidate will work for them or not.

4) K-Means Clustering:
Categorize candidates into two categories with the hope that it may be able to categorize the two types of candidates and put them into the different clusters. As we have the ground truth of the data, we can also try evaluate whether it was able to categorize them or not. \

5) NLP, Deep Learning & Neural Networks:
Perform a set of preprocessing on the data set and then build a high-performance machine learning model that can be used to predict whether a given news is fake or true. (The data file for this project was huge, but you could essentially sample any news article on both models at lines 23, 28 after feeding a new dataset)
